        "* Use cross_validation library\n",
        "* Identify hyper parameters\n",
        "* Disambiguate parameters and hyper parameters\n",
        "* Use grid search to explore hyper parameters\n",
        "* Manually select test/train/validation\n",
        "* Compute AUC for a set of results\n",
        "\n",
        "### Supervised Learning Objectives:\n",
